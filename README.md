Hi there!

Welcome to my programming portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages. Thanks for stopping by.

My name is Jacob, and Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer with a passion for cybersecurity. I'm deploying this portfolio as part of my software engineering journey. I plan to add additional projects as I become more proficient with programming.

Feel free to reuse any code in this respository!

Have a great day,
