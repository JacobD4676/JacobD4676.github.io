Welcome to my programming portfolio! Thanks for stopping by.
This portfolio is being deployed for educational/learning purposes. Feel free to reuse any code in this respository; we can learn together!

Some of the projects in this respository were created by following alongside Udemy courses (see HTML comment(s) at the top of each webpage for attribution). If you are learning to code, definitely give Udemy a look! I have included links to some of the courses I've really enjoyed below.
