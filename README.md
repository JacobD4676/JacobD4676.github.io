Welcome to my programming portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages! Thanks for stopping by.

This portfolio is being deployed for educational/learning purposes. Feel free to reuse any code in this respository; we can learn together!

Some of the projects in this respository were created by following alongside Udemy courses (see HTML comment(s) at the top of each webpage for attribution).

Have a great day,
